INTRO TO RAILS
============================

![GeneralAssemb.ly](https://github.com/generalassembly/ga-ruby-on-rails-for-devs/raw/master/images/ga.png "GeneralAssemb.ly")

This repository contains the in-class labs and homework instructions for the GA San Francisco Intro to Rails course.

As a reminder, the Labs are based off of what we did in class.  They are there to help you solidify concepts, but are not part of your final grade.  The Homework is required and part of your final grade.
