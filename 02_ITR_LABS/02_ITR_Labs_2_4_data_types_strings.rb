# 1. Create 4 new variables, `month`, `day`, `day_of_week` and `year`.
#    Assign each variable appropriately for today's date.
#
#    Example: Tuesday, September 19, 1985
#
#    `Month` should be a Symbol, `day` should be an Integer, `day_of_week`
#    should be a String, and `year` an Integer.


# 2. Construct a sentence of Today's date by concatenating the above
#    variables like the example. Remember to cast appropriately.



# 3. Now, construct the same sentence using String interpolation
#    instead!
#
#    Hint: Do you still need to cast your variables to Strings?



# 4. Let's try and mix things up a bit! Now we are going to take input
#    from the command line and change it so that we can display whatever
#    date the User would like to display.
#
#    prompt the user to enter the day of the week, and store the response in a variable day_of_week



# 5. Now ask for the month and capture that data in the variable month.



# 6. Ask for the day and capture that data in the variable day.



# 7. And finally, do the same for the year!



# 8. Use String interpolation to display the inputted full date to the user.
