The purpose of this lab is to familiarize you with the Ruby Shell, Interactive Ruby (IRB) and some basic ruby expressions.

### Tasks

1. Create a folder for this lab
	1. Open the terminal and navigate to your workspace directory
	1. Create a folder for this lab
	1. Change into the folder you created for this lab
2. Open and Close IRB
	2. Open IRB
	2. Close IRB
3. Use IRB to type and run the following expressions.
	3. Open IRB
	3. Type in each expression, hit enter and observe results
	3. After entering all expressions, reread the output and analyze the results
	3. Exit IRB
4. Use the Ruby Shell to type and run the same expressions you typed into IRB
	4. Create and open a file named hello_expressions.rb
	4. Type in each expression on a new line
	4. Save this hello_expressions.rb
5. Switch back to your terminal
	5. Run hello_expressions.rb using ruby
	5. Observe the results
	5. Analyze the differences between IRB and the Ruby Shell

Here are the expressions to enter:

```

	2 + 2
	
	2 - 3
	
	2 * 3
	
	4.5 + 7
	
	x = 11
