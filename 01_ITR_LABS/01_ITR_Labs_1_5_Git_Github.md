LAB 5: Git & Github
--------

Git is the next big technology in our Ruby development toolbox.  We use git for source control.  We use git for collaboration. We use git for code reviews. We use git for documentation. We use git for collaboration and sharing. We use git in our deployment processes.  We use git to give use the freedom to tear apart and rebuild our code in a different way.
