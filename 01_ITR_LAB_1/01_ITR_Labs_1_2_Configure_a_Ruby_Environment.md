LESSON 1: INTRO TO WEB PROGRAMMING AND GITHUB
========

*Note: The following labs assume Mac OS X operating system.  If your using Linux this should be largely the same.  If your using Windows, please contact instructors for separate exercises.*

*Hari's Note: These are slightly expanded from the ones we did in class.*

**Note: If you successfully installed and configured your environment in class, then you DO NOT need to do this lab again.**

LAB 2: Configure a Ruby Development Environment
--------

The purpose of this lab is to make sure you are up and running with the tools you need for this course.

### Tasks

1. Make sure that you have Administrative Rights on your computer. Programming in Rails will require that you have the password and rights to perform administrative functions on your computer.
2. Make sure you have a Text Editor installed with command line tools (if applicable). Any of the following are okay, but examples will be largely demonstrated in Sublime Text.
	2. Sublime Text
	2. Textmate
	2. BBEdit
	2. Emacs
	2. vim, nano or other CLI-based text editor 
3. Internet Browser: Google Chrome.
4. Signup for a Github account if you don't already have one.
5. Signup for a Heroku account if you don't already have one.
6. Use RailsInstaller to get everything you need for Rails development.
	6. Go to RailsInstaller.org and Download the Kit
	6. Unarchive the downloaded kit (if your system didn't already auto-expand the archive)
	6. Double click the RailsInstaller and follow instructions to install (this may take a while)
	6. Once RailsInstaller is complete, verify your installations.
7. Verify Installation
	7. Quit Terminal if it is Open
	7. Open the Terminal application
	7. Check your version of git `git --version`
	7. Check your version of rvm `rvm info`
	7. Check your version of ruby `ruby -v`
	7. Check your version of rails `rails -v`
8. Go to toolbelt.heroku.com and follow the instructions to install the Heroku tools
	8. Check your heroku installation with `heroku`	
9. Create a folder where you will put all your Ruby and Rails development projects. I suggest using a name that you will easily remember.  I typically would put this in my user's folder `~/workspace` or `~/gaworkspace`.


### Expected Outcome

By the end of this taks you should be able to verify that your environment in configured with he following:

* Git 
* Ruby 1.9.3
* Rails 3.2.11
* Heroku


### Answers & Explanation

Rails is part of an ecosystem of tools each needing their own installation.  Thanks to Wayne Seguin's Rails Installer, this is a much easier task that it used to be!

To understand what this installation process did, review the readme's or documentation for each of these apps.

*Of course, if you still have questions, ask an instructor!*
