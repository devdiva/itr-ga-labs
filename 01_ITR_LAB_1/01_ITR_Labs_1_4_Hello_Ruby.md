LAB 4: Hello Ruby

No intro to a programming language would be complete without a "Hello World".  The purpose of this lab is to use the ruby command to execute the code.


### Tasks

1. Go to the Lesson 1 Labs folder you created in "Lesson 1, Lab 3"
2. Create and open a file named my_first_sript.rb
3. Create a puts hello world statement
4. Declare three variables: first_name, last_name and age
5. Print out something like "Hari Khalsa is not 11" using the variables you created
6. Execute your script from the command line
